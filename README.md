# DBMS in C#

Hey, this is my 3rd semester Coursework for University

The program allows the allows the user to create, edit and work with a DBMS entirely written in C#.

## The Program itself includes: 
- Table Editing(CreateTable, DropTable, ListTables, Tableinfo)
- Data Editing(Select, Where, Delete, Insert)
- AND, NOT, OR, DISTINCT, ORDER BY Support
- Indexing (CreateIndex, DropIndex)
- Data Security(Anti-Tampering and faulty harddrive)
- UI that allows you to View and Select Tables 
  
### As a more-serious project I can say that a lot of things could have been done differently but the amount of knowledge and experience I gained from this whole project have been incredibly useful.
